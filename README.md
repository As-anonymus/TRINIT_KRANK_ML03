#        Machine Learning Crop Prediction Model
TRINIT_KRANK_ML03
Repo for TRI NIT Hackathon


## Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning prediction model. The model is designed to predict a target variable based on a set of input features. The implementation is done in Python and makes use of various libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Python >= 3.6
- scikit-learn >= 0.23.1
- numpy >= 1.19.1
- pandas >= 1.0.3

## Data

The model uses a training dataset to learn the relationship between the input features and the target variable. The dataset should be a CSV file with the following format:

- Each row represents an instance (also known as a sample or example)
- The first row contains the names of the columns (also known as features or variables)
- The first column contains thcodedamne target variable values for each instance
- The remaining columns contain the values of the input features for each instance


## Usage

To use the model, you need to follow the following steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine 

- $ git clone https://github.com/As-anonymus/TRINIT_KRANK_ML03.git
- $ cd ML03

2. Load the training data into the model by providing the path to the CSV file

- $ python

from model import Model
model = Model()
model.load_data('path/to/training/data.csv')

3. Train the model on the training data
model.train()

4. Predict the target variable for a new set of input features
predictions = model.predict([[feature1, feature2, ...]])

5. Evaluate the performance of the model by comparing the predictions with the true target variable values
model.evaluate(predictions, [true_target_variable_value1, true_target_variable_value2, ...])

And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/gocardless/`

## Customization

The model uses a default algorithm (e.g., Random Forest) for training and prediction. You can change the algorithm by modifying the `model.py` file and specifying a different classifier. For example, to use a support vector machine (SVM) instead of Random Forest, replace the following line in `model.py`:
self.classifier = RandomForestClassifier() 
with

self.classifier = SVC()


## Conclusion

This machine learning prediction model provides a simple and flexible way to perform prediction tasks based on input features. The model can be easily customized to use different algorithms and different datasets. The performance of the model can be evaluated by comparing the predictions with the true target variable values.
